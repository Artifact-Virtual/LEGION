#### 2. Start the Frontend Dashboard
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- From the dashboard directory:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
- The dashboard will connect to the backend API for live data.

#### 3. Customizing Dashboards
- To add new widgets or analytics, edit the relevant dashboard module in `enterprise/reporting/dashboards/`.
- To add new API endpoints, extend `backend_api.py` with new routes and data logic.

## Enterprise System Decoupling

- The Artifact Virtual Enterprise system is now a fully standalone module. All operational, dashboard, and backend code is contained within the `enterprise` directory.
- No external dashboard or analytics code is required; all business intelligence and analytics are provided by the dashboards in `reporting/dashboards`.
- Backend API endpoints for all dashboards are provided by `backend_api.py` in the enterprise root.

## Dashboard & API Usage

- To start the backend API:
  ```bash
  python3 backend_api.py
  ```
- To start the dashboard frontend:
  ```bash
  cd reporting/dashboards
  npm install   # (first time only)
  npm start
  ```
- All dashboards are now live, modular, and integrated with real backend data and analytics.
