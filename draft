please pay attntion to the apis now.
the system has 2 or 3 types of apis. i may be wrong check yourself as well

1) the internal system apis that agents use to communiate and perform their tasks.

2) the real wolrd status and infomation consumption stream that is used to import real world data for processing

most of these arent workng.
agent related ones are either malfunctioning or not updating properly at times.

and real world apis are showing mock alternative data meaning these arent working either. 

the system however designed to showcase real data is pulling only mock data. this is unacceptable
