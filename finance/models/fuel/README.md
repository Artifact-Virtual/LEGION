# FUEL Beta 1.0 — Thermodynamic Substrate for Synthetic Civilization

FUEL is not a cryptocurrency. It is a civilization-scale thermoeconomic engine designed to coordinate digital agents, memory, governance, and value through entropy-based economics, neural governance, and programmable volatility.

This repository contains the full specification, simulation outputs, technical architecture, financial models, and launch-ready logic for FUEL Beta 1.0.

FUEL operates across five core mechanics:

    Decay: Idle FUEL decays into an entropy pool

    Bonding: Time-based ROI through wave-modes (short, mid, long)

    Quantum: Controlled price volatility through stochastic triggers

    Memory: Contributions are logged as long-term influence

    Governance: Hybrid neural-human system adjusts economic parameters

The AI adjusts decay, bonding returns, and quantum volatility based on live feedback from agent behavior, entropy levels, and liquidity oscillation.
🚀 Launch Plan

    Simulate agent behavior using testnet FUEL

    Evolve economic parameters through live governance

    Launch Mainnet FUEL as fundable layer, back-tested by entropy mechanics

    Bond liquidity, inject volatility, and unlock synthetic instruments

The future isn’t static. It’s thermodynamic.
