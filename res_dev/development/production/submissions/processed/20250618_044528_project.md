## Modular AI Agent Project Instructions

This project aims to create a comprehensive suite of modular AI agents, each implemented as a **separate, self-contained robot**. Each agent should be developed, tested, and perfected individually, with its own codebase and configuration. Agents must be able to integrate with LLMs, storage, APIs, or any other required services as needed for their specific tasks.

### Project Structure

- **Each agent is a separate module/file/repository.**
- No single orchestrating file; agents are not tightly coupled.
- Agents should expose clear interfaces (e.g., CLI, API, or callable functions) for integration.
- Each agent should be independently deployable and testable.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Create a separate directory or repository for each agent.**
2. **Develop each agent independently**—focus on its core tasks and required integrations (LLM, storage, APIs, etc.).
3. **Expose a clear interface** (e.g., REST API, CLI, or callable Python module) for each agent.
4. **Document setup, configuration, and usage** for each agent in its own README.
5. **Iterate and perfect each agent** before moving to the next.
6. **Ensure agents are modular and reusable**—they should not depend on a central orchestrator.
7. **Agents can be composed or integrated later** as needed, but must remain independently functional.

**Start with simple, high-impact agents. Build, test, and document each one individually. Modular design ensures flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.**
