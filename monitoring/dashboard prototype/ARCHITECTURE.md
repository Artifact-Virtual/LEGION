# Monitoring Dashboard: Architectural Blueprint

## 1. Overview
A modular, extensible, and advanced monitoring dashboard for enterprise systems. Designed for seamless integration/disintegration with diverse data sources, real-time analytics, and advanced developer/research tooling.

---

## 2. Core Architecture

### A. Frontend (Angular)
- **UI Frameworks:** Angular 20+, Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, Three.js/D3.js
- **Core Modules:**
  - Executive Summary & System Health
  - Real-Time Metrics & Charts
  - 2D/3D/Graph Visualizations
  - Logs & Reports Viewer
  - Agent/Process/Task Monitoring
  - API/Data Source Management (+ add/remove/standby/disable)
  - Advanced Tooling (Dev/Research Console, Query Builder, Data Explorer)
  - Notification & Alert System
  - User/Role Management (optional)
- **State Management:** NgRx or RxJS
- **Plugin System:** For custom panels, visualizations, or tools

### B. Backend (Python)
- **API Layer:** FastAPI/Flask for REST & WebSocket endpoints
- **Data Adapters:** Modular connectors for databases, logs, files, external/internal APIs
- **Live Data Engine:** Pushes real-time events/metrics to frontend (WebSocket, SSE)
- **Log/Report Ingestion:** Unified interface for structured/unstructured data
- **API Registry:** Dynamic management of available APIs (add, remove, standby, configure)
- **Automation Hooks:** Trigger scripts, workflows, or research tools from dashboard
- **Security:** JWT/OAuth2, CORS, RBAC

### C. Data Flow
```
[Data Sources: APIs, DBs, Logs, Files]
        |
   [Backend Adapters/Registry]
        |
   [API Layer: REST/WebSocket]
        |
   [Frontend: Modular UI Components]
        |
   [User/Dev/Researcher]
```

## 3. Extensibility & Modularity
- **Adapters:** Each data source/API is an independent module (hot-pluggable)
- **Plugin Panels:** Add/remove dashboard features without core changes
- **API Management UI:**
  - Add new API/data source (form-driven, with validation)
  - Configure endpoints, auth, polling/streaming, standby/disable
  - Remove or temporarily turn off APIs
  - View API health/status, logs, and usage analytics
- **Tooling:**
  - Built-in dev console (query, test, debug APIs)
  - Research mode: data exploration, notebook integration, export/import
  - Productivity unlocks: quick actions, automation triggers, custom scripts

---

## 4. Security & Integration
- **Auth:** JWT/OAuth2, SSO-ready
- **RBAC:** Fine-grained permissions for users, admins, researchers
- **Audit:** Track API/data source changes, user actions, and system events
- **Integration:**
  - Easy to embed in other systems or run standalone
  - API for dashboard configuration (import/export settings)

## 5. Example Directory Structure
```

    src/app/
      core/           # API/data services, adapters
      features/       # Dashboard modules (metrics, logs, 3D, etc.)
      plugins/        # Custom/third-party panels
      shared/         # UI components, utilities

```

## 6. Roadmap & Next Steps
1. Scaffold Angular and Python backend projects
2. Implement API/data source registry and management UI
3. Build core dashboard modules (metrics, logs, 3D, etc.)
4. Add plugin/tooling system for dev/research productivity
5. Harden security, add RBAC, and document extensibility

*This blueprint is designed for maximum flexibility, developer productivity, and research enablement. Every feature is modular, discoverable, and manageable from the dashboard UI.*
