// --- Footer: System Integration Notes & Potential Issues (MVP) ---
/*
This MVP artifact is designed for integration into the larger supercomputer system.
Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the broader whole,
with a focus on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

**Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
- [Issue 1]: Global State Synchronization Latency: The `evaluateSystemState` method relies on "synchronously collected metrics". Achieving a truly consistent, real-time snapshot of metrics across thousands of nodes simultaneously is a significant challenge.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement a distributed, low-latency state aggregation service utilizing techniques like synchronous checkpoints or a high-speed data bus with strict timing guarantees. Potentially use a pull-based model triggered by a global clock tick.
- [Issue 2]: Policy/Target Broadcast Consistency: `distributeResourcePolicy` and `setPerformanceTargets` assume synchronous application. Ensuring all relevant subsystems *atomically* adopt the new parameters at the same logical time is complex in a distributed environment.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Utilize a consensus algorithm (e.g., Paxos, Raft variant) or a two-phase commit protocol for distributing critical configuration updates, guaranteeing all-or-nothing application.
- [Issue 3]: Recalibration Sequence Synchronization: `initiateSystemRecalibration` simulates a synchronous command broadcast. Coordinating actual complex system-wide state transitions (e.g., partial shutdowns, reconfigurations) without race conditions or deadlocks requires a robust, synchronized choreography engine.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Develop a distributed state machine or workflow engine specifically designed for synchronized system management operations, with rollback capabilities and guaranteed message delivery.
- [Issue 4]: Mathematical Model Drift: The 'mathematical feasibility' checks in `setPerformanceTargets` rely on hardcoded or potentially stale system capacity models. As the system evolves or components degrade, the models may lose synchronicity with reality, leading to setting unachievable targets that disrupt equilibrium.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Implement dynamic, real-time system modeling and simulation capabilities that are continuously synchronized with actual performance data. Integrate these models into the target validation process.
- [Issue 5]: Dependency on External Clock Synchronization: The concept of "synchronous" operations often relies on a globally synchronized clock source. Drifts or failures in the underlying NTP or PTP (Precision Time Protocol) system can break the temporal synchronicity assumed by tasks like orchestrated recalibration.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Implement redundant, highly accurate clock synchronization mechanisms. Design protocols to be resilient to minor clock skew or capable of operating within defined time tolerances. Potentially use logical clocks or vector clocks for causality tracking in some contexts.
