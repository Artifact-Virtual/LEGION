    // --- Potential Integration Considerations (Smart Contract Context) ---
    /*
    This MVP contract provides an on-chain state representation for system equilibrium.
    Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the off-chain
    supercomputer system and broader blockchain environment, focusing on maintaining
    synchronicity and equilibrium validation:

    **Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
    - [Issue 1]: **Reliance on Off-chain Oracles for Data Synchronicity:** The contract assumes the `AggregateMetrics` and `ResourceSummary`/`loads` inputs are derived from truly synchronous off-chain snapshots. If the oracle feed is stale, inconsistent, or based on unsynchronized data collection, the on-chain state will not accurately reflect the supercomputer's real-time equilibrium.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement a robust, decentralized oracle network that enforces strict data freshness and consistency requirements (e.g., multi-party signing, time-stamping, consensus on collected data). Use Chainlink or similar oracle solutions configured for high data integrity and low latency feeds.
    - [Issue 2]: **Gas Costs and Data Granularity:** Processing fine-grained metrics or loads for a large number of nodes/resources within the smart contract is prohibitively expensive due to gas limits. The current design relies on aggregated data, which reduces the contract's ability to detect * localized* desynchronization or imbalance issues within the supercomputer.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Keep complex, node-level analysis off-chain. Use the contract for high-level aggregate status checks and critical state transitions. Utilize Layer 2 solutions or off-chain computation frameworks (like Chainlink Keepers or similar) for processing larger datasets, with the L1 contract storing only the verified outcome.
    - [Issue 3]: **Actionability of On-Chain State:** The contract can report imbalance or critical states, but it cannot directly *act* on the supercomputer (e.g., initiate load balancing, restart nodes). Actions must be triggered by off-chain systems reacting to contract state changes or events.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Design off-chain "watchers" or "executors" that monitor the contract's state and events (`EquilibriumStateChanged`). These off-chain components are responsible for translating on-chain status updates into concrete operational commands within the supercomputer cluster. Ensure these executors are reliable and fault-tolerant.
    - [Issue 4]: **Transaction Latency and Ordering:** State updates on the blockchain are subject to network latency, block times, and transaction ordering (MEV). A critical state change might be delayed in propagating, or multiple state-changing transactions might arrive out of chronological order relative to off-chain events.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Use a blockchain platform with low latency and predictable finality. Implement sequence numbers or timestamps in transaction payloads (signed by the off-chain system) which the contract can use to discard out-of-order updates, or rely on the blockchain's inherent transaction ordering within a block. Consider optimistic updates with potential rollbacks for less critical data.
    - [Issue 5]: **Single Point of Failure in Oracle/Feeder System:** If the system feeding data to the smart contract is centralized or fails, the on-chain state becomes stale, inaccurate, and unable to reflect the true supercomputer equilibrium.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Decentralize the oracle/data feeding mechanism. Use a network of independent reporters. Implement liveness checks and reputation systems for data providers. Consider slashing mechanisms for submitting false or malicious data.
