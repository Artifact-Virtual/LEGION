// --- Footer: System Integration Notes & Potential Issues (MVP) ---
/*
This MVP artifact is designed for integration into the larger supercomputer system.
Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the broader whole,
with a focus on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

**Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
- [Issue 1]: Network partitioning or high latency preventing timely collection of synchronous metric snapshots from all nodes required by `processSystemMetrics`.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement robust retry mechanisms, partial processing capabilities (operating on available data while flagging missing nodes), and prioritize reliable, low-latency network fabrics for critical operational data channels. Use a distributed consensus mechanism for agreeing on the set of 'active' nodes for a snapshot.
- [Issue 2]: Challenges in implementing the *simulation* of synchronous load redistribution (`redistributeLoadSynchronously`) in a truly distributed, failure-prone environment without a global clock or transaction coordinator.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Introduce a distributed transaction framework (e.g., Two-Phase Commit) or a distributed ledger technology (e.g., Raft consensus for state changes) to ensure atomicity and consistency of load adjustments across multiple resources/nodes.
- [Issue 3]: State divergence where different instances of the `VPOperationsSystemOpsArtifact` or interacting modules have inconsistent views of system health or resource loads due to communication delays.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Adopt an eventual consistency model for less critical state with conflict resolution, or use strong consistency protocols (like Paxos/Raft) for core operational state data stores. Publish state changes via a reliable message bus.
- [Issue 4]: Race conditions or deadlocks when multiple operational tasks or artifacts attempt to modify resource allocations or system state simultaneously without proper coordination.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Implement a centralized or distributed mutex/lock service for critical resource modification paths. Utilize message queues and worker patterns to serialize sensitive operations or process them idempotently.
- [Issue 5]: Drifting time synchronization between nodes affecting the validity of timestamps used for metric synchronization and timed operational commands.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Employ a highly reliable Network Time Protocol (NTP) service across the cluster or implement a specialized distributed clock synchronization protocol if sub-millisecond precision is required for critical operations.
