// --- Footer: System Integration Notes & Potential Issues (MVP) ---
/*
This MVP artifact is designed for integration into the larger supercomputer system, acting as a key component
in monitoring and verifying system equilibrium and synchronicity.
Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the broader whole,
with a focus on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

**Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
- [Issue 1]: Clock synchronization variance across distributed nodes providing status reports, affecting the temporal consistency checks in `collectAndValidateSubsystemStatuses`.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement a system-wide, high-precision clock synchronization service (e.g., PTP - Precision Time Protocol or NTP with local atomic clocks) and include timestamp tolerance configuration.
- [Issue 2]: Network partition or transient latency spikes impacting the synchronous completion requirement of `performSynchronousHeartbeat`, leading to false positives for unit failure or degraded state.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Implement multi-path communication strategies, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and correlation logic to distinguish transient network issues from actual unit failures. Consider a secondary, asynchronous health check system.
- [Issue 3]: State reporting mechanisms from subsystems might not be atomic or might suffer from race conditions, leading to inconsistent snapshots being collected by the Team Lead.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Standardize subsystem reporting protocols to include versioning or sequence numbers, utilize message queuing with guaranteed delivery for status updates, and potentially implement snapshotting or consensus on reported states.
- [Issue 4]: Synchronous logging failure across multiple endpoints could lead to partial log entries or loss of critical event history necessary for debugging equilibrium failures.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Implement persistent queues before logging endpoints, incorporate transactional logging or distributed commit protocols (e.g., 2PC) for critical events, and utilize checksums/hashes to verify log integrity across replicas.
- [Issue 5]: The mathematical equilibrium checks rely on the timely and accurate reporting of subsystem metrics. Delayed or corrupt metrics can lead to incorrect equilibrium assessments.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Implement robust data validation and cleansing pipelines for metrics, utilize time-series databases with built-in interpolation/anomaly detection, and develop fallback mechanisms or utilize redundant metric sources.
