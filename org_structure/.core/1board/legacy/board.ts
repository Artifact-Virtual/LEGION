/*
This MVP artifact for the Board of Directors is designed for integration into the larger supercomputer system.
It provides core functions for high-level policy management, equilibrium validation, and strategic directive issuance,
with a focus on ensuring synchronous operations where critical for system state consistency.
Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the broader whole,
with a focus on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

**Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
- [Issue 1]: **Reliable Consistent Snapshot Access:** The `validateSystemEquilibrium` method relies on obtaining a *truly* consistent snapshot of global system metrics. Integration requires a robust, underlying distributed service capable of providing such a snapshot without introducing significant read latency or skew, which could break the logical synchronicity of the validation check.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement a dedicated, high-performance distributed snapshot service utilizing techniques like Chandy–Lamport algorithm variants or synchronized checkpointing across nodes. Ensure this service is highly available and low-latency.
- [Issue 2]: **Strict Synchronous Communication Guarantees:** Methods like `distributePolicyUpdate` and `issueStrategicDirective` require synchronous confirmation from multiple distributed components within a strict time window. This depends heavily on the underlying inter-component communication fabric's reliability, latency, and ability to enforce strict message ordering and timeliness.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Utilize a message bus or RPC framework with strong guarantees on message delivery, ordering, and bounded latency. Implement timeouts and retry logic with backoff strategies, coupled with a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft) for critical state updates that require global agreement.
- [Issue 3]: **Handling of Partial Failures During Synchronous Operations:** If a critical component fails to confirm policy receipt or directive acknowledgment synchronously, the MVP currently logs an error and marks status as 'Degraded'. A more robust system needs a defined failure recovery plan that maintains equilibrium (e.g., rolling back changes, isolating the failing component, retrying with specific strategies, triggering system-level failover).
- [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Design atomic, distributed transactions for policy updates and directives. Implement compensating actions for failed steps and use a distributed transaction coordinator. Incorporate circuit breakers and bulkheads to prevent cascading failures from a single component's desynchronization.
- [Issue 4]: **Mathematical Verification of Global Equilibrium under Dynamic Conditions:** The `validateSystemEquilibrium` uses hardcoded checks. Verifying equilibrium in a complex, dynamic supercomputer under changing loads requires sophisticated mathematical models and real-time analysis, potentially involving complex event processing (CEP) or AI-driven anomaly detection acting on the consistent snapshot data.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Develop a formal model of system equilibrium, incorporating queuing theory, resource graphs, and performance models. Integrate a real-time analytics engine capable of evaluating this model against live, consistent system state data.
- [Issue 5]: **Synchronization with Global Clock Skew:** Time-sensitive synchronization (using `policy.timestamp` or `directive.timestamp`) is vulnerable to clock skew between different nodes hosting the artifacts and components. Significant skew can cause valid confirmations to be rejected as "late" or vice-versa, breaking the logical synchronicity.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Implement a robust, system-wide clock synchronization mechanism, preferably hardware-assisted (e.g., PTP - Precision Time Protocol) or using highly accurate distributed time services (like Google's TrueTime if applicable), significantly reducing potential skew below synchronization tolerance thresholds.
