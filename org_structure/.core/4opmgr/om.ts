// --- Footer: System Integration Notes & Potential Issues (MVP) ---
/*
This MVP artifact is designed for integration into the larger supercomputer system.
Below are potential issues and considerations for its interaction with the broader whole,
with a focus on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

**Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
- [Issue 1]: State staleness in 'checkSystemEquilibrium' if underlying component state reporting is asynchronous or delayed, leading to false positives/negatives on equilibrium assessments. The "synchronicity" of the check relies on the underlying state data being consistently timestamped or snapshotted across components.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Implement a system-wide distributed snapshot mechanism or a high-frequency, low-latency state broadcasting service with sequence numbering. Utilize hardware-level clock synchronization (e.g., PTP) and software-level adjustments to minimize skew impacting state collection.
- [Issue 2]: Latency variability or complete network partitioning affecting the two-phase commit in 'coordinateStateCommit', potentially leading to split-brain scenarios if commit acknowledgments or coordinator states are lost. This directly threatens the atomic nature required for synchronous state transitions.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Employ robust, fault-tolerant consensus algorithms (e.g., Paxos, Raft) or sophisticated transaction coordinators with timeout, retry logic, durable state logging, and a defined recovery process from partitions or coordinator failures. Implement fencing mechanisms to prevent rogue components from acting based on stale state.
- [Issue 3]: Resource contention or deadlocks arising if synchronous operations require exclusive access to resources also needed by other independent high-priority tasks running concurrently across the system, disrupting global progress and equilibrium.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Design a hierarchical or distributed resource management system aware of system-wide requests and dependencies. Potentially use ordered locking (e.g., by unit ID or resource type) or a dedicated, highly available lock manager service to serialize access to critical shared resources in a consistent manner.
- [Issue 4]: Scalability challenges for synchronous coordination tasks (like 2PC) as the number of participating components or the frequency of operations increases. The time required to achieve system-wide consensus or collect all necessary state data synchronously can become a bottleneck, impacting overall throughput and the system's ability to react quickly to maintain equilibrium.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Explore alternative consistency models (e.g., eventual consistency with strong conflict resolution) for less critical operations. For high-throughput scenarios requiring strong consistency, shard the system or use specialized hardware/networking (e.g., RDMA) to reduce latency. Consider decentralized coordination patterns where possible.
- [Issue 5]: Difficulties in formal verification of the 'coordinateStateCommit' logic under all possible failure modes (network, node, process failures) to guarantee atomicity and equilibrium maintenance in complex, distributed scenarios. The state space of potential interactions and failures is vast.
- [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Use formal methods, model checking tools, and theorem provers during the design phase to mathematically prove properties of the distributed protocol. Implement thorough fault injection testing and large-scale simulations in environments that mimic supercomputer failure patterns to empirically validate resilience and consistency.
