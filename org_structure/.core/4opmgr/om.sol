    /// --- Footer: System Integration Notes & Potential Issues (MVP) ---
    /*
    This MVP smart contract artifact is a conceptual representation based on the
    TypeScript supercomputer artifact. It operates within the deterministic and
    atomic execution environment of a blockchain, which fundamentally differs
    from a distributed supercomputer cluster.

    Below are potential issues and considerations for mapping these concepts
    to a blockchain environment, focusing on maintaining synchronicity and equilibrium:

    **Potential Integration Issues & Considerations:**
    - [Issue 1]: **State Source:** `check_system_equilibrium` operates on input data. It cannot synchronously fetch live, globally consistent state from off-chain supercomputer components or other contracts without relying on potentially delayed or unreliable oracles/cross-contract calls. The "synchronicity" is only within the execution of the single transaction.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 1]: Use trusted oracles with defined data freshness guarantees, or require off-chain components to push signed state snapshots to the contract periodically for it to check. Acknowledge that the contract's view of system equilibrium is based on potentially stale or aggregated data.
    - [Issue 2]: **Coordinated Commit Realism:** `coordinate_state_commit` simulates 2PC by performing atomic updates to internal contract state. It does *not* coordinate state changes in real external systems or other contracts in a truly fault-tolerant, network-partition-aware way within a single transaction. Real distributed 2PC failures (e.g., node crash during commit) cannot be simulated and handled robustly within a single deterministic contract call.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 2]: Implement multi-transaction coordination protocols involving off-chain orchestrators or state machines within the contract requiring sequential calls. This sacrifices single-transaction synchronicity for distributed protocol realism. Consider using optimistic concurrency or eventual consistency patterns where appropriate.
    - [Issue 3]: **Gas Limits:** Complex or data-intensive calculations (like variance/std dev on very large input arrays) or processing many unit updates in `coordinate_state_commit` within a single message can hit blockchain gas limits, causing the transaction to fail and roll back.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 3]: Optimize calculations, process data in smaller batches across multiple transactions, or rely on off-chain computation for heavy lifting (e.g., checking equilibrium off-chain and providing a verified result to the contract).
    - [Issue 4]: **Deterministic Simulation Limitations:** Simulating non-deterministic real-world failures (like network latency or random node crashes) deterministically within a contract is challenging or misleading. Pseudo-randomness sources (like block hash) offer limited security and can still be influenced by block producers.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 4]: Design contract logic around deterministic outcomes based on explicit input parameters or simplified assumptions. Use off-chain simulations for non-deterministic scenario testing.
    - [Issue 5]: **Time Synchronization:** `block_timestamp` is the only source of time, controlled by validators and tied to block production, not wall-clock time across a supercomputer cluster. It may have limited precision and granularity compared to system-level timestamps.
    - [Resolution/Mitigation 5]: Design protocols to be resilient to timestamp variations and rely on block numbers or sequence numbers for ordering critical events where exact real-world time is not strictly necessary. Use off-chain mechanisms for high-precision timing.
